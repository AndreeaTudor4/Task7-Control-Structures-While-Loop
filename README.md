# Average Number Calculator

## Description
This Python program allows users to input a series of numbers which are then used to calculate the average. The program continues to request numbers until the user inputs `-1`, which signals the end of the input process. The average of the entered numbers, excluding the termination signal, is then calculated and displayed.
